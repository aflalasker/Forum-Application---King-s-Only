### Brief Overview of the Application

This a web based **Forum** Application developed using the **Rails** framework. The Application is deployed in the **Heroku server**, and can be found using this **link: wwwwwwwwww**

The Application has **Two Categories,** a space for the Staff to add posts and space for the Students to add Posts. The Staffs have the rights to **Create, Edit, and Delete** Posts throughout the Forum, including the Students Space. On the other hand, the students can only add Posts in the Students space, and **cannot** manipulate any Posts made by the Staff.

The Forum Application is linked to the **King's College London's Microsoft App**, this means the Students and Staff who use this service should be **registered** KCL users. Students and Staffs should use their KCL email address to sign-up to use the service, and then they can sign-in to the Forum application using the KCL email. Then the Students and Staff who sign-in to the forum can View, Add Posts, and add Comments to Posts. However, in-order to Edit a Post, you should be the owner of the Post.
